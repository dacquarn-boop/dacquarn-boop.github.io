    <h2>Summarizing Statement</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Computer Systems Technician – Software Support student at Mohawk College with a strong interest in project management, system support, 
      security, and software development. I enjoy organizing tasks, breaking down problems, and creating clear solutions that help projects stay on track.
      I also like understanding how systems work, solving technical issues, and learning best practices for keeping environments reliable and secure.
      I’m always improving my skills by working on tech projects, learning new tools, and building simple applications. My goal is to gain
      real experience and grow into a role where I can support teams, contribute to well-designed software, and help keep systems running smoothly.
